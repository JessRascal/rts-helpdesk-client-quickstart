# RTS Helpdesk: Client Quickstart Guide

Client quickstart guide for RTS's current helpdesk application.

## Running Locally

`bundle exec jeyll server`

## Markdown Style Guide

The following rules should be followed when creating new markdown documents.

- Include the trailing `/` in all links
- Ensure all examples of issues are not specific to a single system because users from any system will be using this guide (e.g. "Unable to import data" instead of "Unable to import an NROL report")

## Notes

Just some general notes.

- **Open markdown links in a new tab**

  ```HTML
  [link name](url_link){:target="_blank"}
  ```
