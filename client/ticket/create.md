# Creating a Support Ticket

If your internal support department is unable to resolve an issue with one of the applications developed by RTS, then it needs to be raised in the form of a ticket on the [RTS helpdesk](https://helpdesk.rts-solutions.net){:target="_blank"}.

Complete the following to create a new support ticket:

- Log into the [RTS helpdesk](https://helpdesk.rts-solutions.net){:target="_blank"}
- On the main screen, select the **Add** button
![Add Ticket Button](assets/images/ticket-add-button.png)
- A form is displayed that needs to be completed as follows:
  - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g. Unable to Access the Dashboard)
  - **Project**: Select the relevant project/application for the issue (there may be only one option available)
  - **Severity**: Select what you believe the severity of the issue is from the options below:
    - **1 - Critical**: A major issue impacting all users (e.g. unable to log in), or with a potential safety or high commercial impact
    - **2 - High**: An issue with an essential piece of functionality (e.g. unable to import data)
    - **3 - Medium**: An issue with a secondary piece of functionality (e.g. unable to view the history of a record)
    - **4 - Low**: A minor issue with any piece of functionality
    - **5 - Cosmetic**: Something that you think needs changing from a purely "look and feel" point of view (e.g. changing the colour of a button)
    - **Request**: A request for an enhancement or information
    - **Complaint**: You are not happy with how support is being provided by RTS
  - **Description**: Enter a description of the issue you are having
  - **Steps to Recreate**: If possible, enter the steps you took in the application that resulted in the issue you are facing

> **Note**: The more accurate the information you provide for the **description** and **steps to recreate**, the more likely RTS will be able to provide a solution in a timely manner.

- Once you are happy with the details you have entered, select **Save & Close** to finish creating your ticket

___
When you create a new support ticket, it is given a status of **Reported** as the starting point of its [lifecycle](client/ticket/lifecycle/).

RTS will automatically be notified of the creation of your new ticket.

You will be sent [email notifications](client/general/notifications/) throughout the lifecycle of your ticket that alert you to any changes that have been made to it by RTS or another person in your company.

You can [edit](client/ticket/edit/) the details of your ticket at any point after it has been created.
