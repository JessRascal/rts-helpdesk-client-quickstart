# Accessing the RTS Helpdesk

To access the [RTS helpdesk](https://helpdesk.rts-solutions.net){:target="_blank"}, you will need to have an account created for you by RTS.

If you don't have an RTS helpdesk account, then you need to request one via the person in your organisation that manages the support agreement with RTS.

This person can then put a request in with RTS for an additional account.
