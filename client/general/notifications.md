# Email Notifications

Once you have [created a ticket](/client/ticket/create), you will be sent an email notification every time a change is made to the details of that ticket.

You need to pay attention to these notifciations when you receive them because the change to the ticket may have resulted in you needing to perform an action (e.g. you need to supply more information regarding the issue).
